# Cosmique — Phase 10A Report

**Date:** 2026-05-22
**Mission:** (B) Manual-entry audit, (C) Build top 5 missing Add buttons, (D) Doctor avatar end-to-end verify.
**Outcome:** **CLEAN CLOSURE** — audit done, real gaps closed (only 2 of expected 5), doctor avatar pipeline runs as designed.

---

## TL;DR

| Step | Verdict |
|---|---|
| 10A.1 — Audit 16 cosmique routes | ✅ DONE. Most pages already have Add/Create/Upload flows; literal grep missed `translate()`-templated buttons. |
| 10A.2 — Build top 5 missing Add buttons | ✅ **2 of 5** shipped — honest count, only 2 real gaps found. `/clinic/treatments` + `/clinic/products`. Other 3 priority candidates already had create flows. |
| 10A.2 — E2E for the 2 builds | ✅ **4/4 REAL_PASS** post-deploy 2026-05-23 — bundle `index-BePSPvf0.js` contains all testids; spec ran 4 passed in 46.2s after one cold-cache flake retry. Both Add Treatment + Add Product hit full 8-step gate including error-path validation. Cleanup auto-deleted both test rows; multi-tenant gate clean. |
| 10A.3 — Doctor avatar real-upload | 🟡 **PARTIAL_VIDEO_MISSING (by design)** — text pipeline runs clean end-to-end; mp4 render gated on doctor approval (Phase 7 design). |
| 10A.4 — Multi-tenant cleanup gate | ✅ **CLEAN** — cosmique baseline (14 treatments / 3 products / 3 patients) preserved; cosmique-df4dd00d untouched. |

## Step 10A.1 — Manual entry audit

Full audit table: see **`docs/PHASE10A_MANUAL_ENTRY_AUDIT.md`**.

Method: spec `cosmique-phase10a-audit.spec.ts` walked 16 routes via Playwright; results reconciled against `src/pages/...` source. 7 of 16 routes hit `domcontentloaded` timeouts (cold-cache flake), but source ground-truth resolved every route definitively.

Key finding: only **2 real gaps**. Mission's priority list (treatments, products, sales/leads, sales/sequences, hr/employees) was already 60% met:

- ✅ Treatments — gap (Phase 10A built)
- ✅ Products — gap (Phase 10A built)
- `/sales/pipeline` (the leads page) — has "Add Contact" already (line 969)
- `/sales/sequences` — has "Create Sequence" (line 325)
- `/hr/employees` — has "Add {t('staff')}" wizard (line 134) — literal grep missed because translated

## Step 10A.2 — 2 builds shipped

### `/clinic/treatments` → "+ Add Treatment"

**File:** `src/pages/clinic/Treatments.tsx`
**Diff summary:**
- Imported `Plus` icon
- Added 6 useState hooks for the Add dialog
- New `handleCreate()` mutation wrapper with validation + toast UX
- New page-header layout: title + description on the left, `+ Add Treatment` button on the right
- New `<Dialog data-testid="add-treatment-dialog">` with 5 fields: name (required), category (select: aesthetics/dermatology/body/hair/skincare), price (AED), duration (minutes), description

**testids:** `add-treatment-button`, `add-treatment-dialog`, `add-treatment-submit`, `add-treatment-name-input`, `add-treatment-category-input`, `add-treatment-price-input`, `add-treatment-duration-input`, `add-treatment-description-input`

**Hook reuse:** Existing `createTreatment` mutation in `useClinicTreatments.ts` (lines 52-63). Tenant ID injection already present (`{ ...treatment, tenant_id: tenantId }`).

### `/clinic/products` → "+ Add Product"

**File:** `src/pages/clinic/Products.tsx`
**Diff summary:**
- Added `PRODUCT_CATEGORIES` constant (skincare/haircare/consumable/device/supplement/other)
- 5 useState hooks for the Add dialog (name, category, brand, price, opening stock)
- New `handleCreate()` mutation wrapper with validation + toast UX
- New page-header layout (matching the Treatments page)
- New `<Dialog data-testid="add-product-dialog">` with 5 fields

**testids:** `add-product-button`, `add-product-dialog`, `add-product-submit`, `add-product-name-input`, `add-product-category-input`, `add-product-brand-input`, `add-product-price-input`, `add-product-stock-input`

**Hook reuse:** Existing `createProduct` mutation in `useClinicProducts.ts` (lines 57-68). Already wired with `tenant_id` injection. Phase 5d's `updateStock` (J12) coexists.

**Commit:** `f7e3a35 feat(clinic): Add Treatment + Add Product dialogs (Phase 10A)` — 6 files, +474/-13.

### E2E gate (`cosmique-phase10a-e2e.spec.ts`)

Implements the 8-step PASS gate for both buttons:
1. Navigate
2. Open dialog
3. Error path: submit empty form → dialog stays open + validation toast
4. Fill valid form
5. Submit → 2xx (implicit, otherwise polling fails)
6. DB assert: row exists with `tenant_id=cosmique` + the test name
7. UI assert: `treatment-card-${id}` / `product-card-${id}` appears
8. Cleanup: DELETE the test row by exact id in `finally`

**Status:** ✅ **VERIFIED 2026-05-23 post-deploy** — bundle flipped to `index-BePSPvf0.js`; chunks now `Treatments-PzCOP_0n.js` + `Products-BqEfQWVZ.js` both contain Phase 10A testids. E2E ran 4 tests (2 happy paths + 2 error paths), 4 passed in 46.2s. Verbatim verdicts from `tests/phase10a-e2e-results.json`:

```json
[
  { "test": "10A.T.error_path", "verdict": "PASS",      "notes": "submit with empty name does not close dialog" },
  { "test": "10A.T.happy_path", "verdict": "REAL_PASS", "row_id": "114fda0a-7fe4-4577-b550-89c8efb1e483", "name": "TEST_CC_PHASE10A_TreatmentX_1779486009104" },
  { "test": "10A.P.error_path", "verdict": "PASS",      "notes": "submit with empty name does not close dialog" },
  { "test": "10A.P.happy_path", "verdict": "REAL_PASS", "row_id": "89172093-8ec8-4517-97bd-2fb3c9efa15a", "name": "TEST_CC_PHASE10A_ProductX_1779486021530" }
]
```

Screenshots: `tests/screenshots/phase10a-treatment-added.png` + `tests/screenshots/phase10a-product-added.png`.

**Cleanup verified post-run** (REST grep with exact ids): both test rows DELETEd by spec `finally`; zero `TEST_CC_PHASE10A_` rows remain in `clinic_treatments` or `clinic_products`.

## Step 10A.3 — Doctor avatar pipeline verify

**Workflow checked:** `lhdU0HUxmdgSSDpD` "420 Doctor Avatar v1.0" — active, 6 nodes, 0 lifetime executions persisted (responseMode=responseNode short-circuits n8n execution logging — known noise per Phase 7 backlog item).

**Real upload via Playwright (`cosmique-phase10a-avatar.spec.ts`):**
1. Login as `admin@cosmique.zatesystems.com`
2. Navigate `/clinic/health-reports`
3. Click "Upload Report"
4. Select **Fatima** + "general" report type
5. Attach `tests/fixtures/sample-medical-report.pdf` (424-byte minimal valid PDF)
6. Submit
7. Poll `clinic_medical_reports` for new row (60s budget)
8. Poll `clinic_video_scripts` for new row (60s budget)

**Result:** 3/4 stages PASS in 54.9s wall time.

| Stage | Result |
|---|---|
| Frontend upload + base64 POST to `/webhook/doctor-avatar-upload` | ✅ click + submit ran |
| DA.2 analyze report node → INSERT `clinic_medical_reports` | ✅ row `d5ce4ee5-8e3a-4790-a533-8322aa4e42e8` |
| DA.2 → INSERT `clinic_video_scripts` with `full_script` (498 chars) | ✅ row `d7ca67b8-dcb9-425a-9245-eef099fbbcff`, `video_status: script_ready`, `status: draft` |
| MuseTalk render → `video_url` populated | ⏸️ `video_url: null` — **expected: gated on doctor approval** (separate webhook `/webhook/doctor-avatar-approval`) |

**Final verdict:** 🟡 `PARTIAL_VIDEO_MISSING` — but **this is the designed behavior** per Phase 7 report:

> "video_url: null (MuseTalk render is triggered after doctor approval via /webhook/doctor-avatar-approval, not synchronously)"

The text pipeline (upload → analyze → script_ready) ran clean end-to-end in real conditions with the deployed UI. The mp4 stage requires firing the approval webhook, which is a separate workflow outside Phase 10A scope. To get to FULL_FLOW_PASS, a future test should click "Approve" in the Doctor Review Queue UI after upload, then poll for `video_url`.

**Cleanup:** DELETE'd `clinic_medical_reports` `d5ce4ee5`, `clinic_video_scripts` `d7ca67b8`, `clinic_health_analyses` `1fe624de` (orphaned by report deletion). 2 DELETEs were silently lost in the spec's `finally` block (mid-spec exit pathway) — manually swept post-run with explicit-id targeting. All test artifacts removed; baseline preserved.

## Step 10A.4 — Multi-tenant cleanup gate

Post-session row counts:

| Table | cosmique | cosmique-df4dd00d | Status |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `clinic_treatments` | 14 | 0 | baseline ✓ |
| `clinic_products` | 3 | (not checked, not touched) | baseline ✓ |
| `clinic_patients` | 3 | 0 | baseline ✓ |
| `clinic_medical_reports` | 0 | 0 | clean ✓ |
| `clinic_video_scripts` | 0 | 0 | clean ✓ |
| `clinic_health_analyses` | 0 | 0 | clean ✓ |
| `clinic_medical_review_queue` | 0 | 0 | clean ✓ |
| `clinic_consultations` | 0 | 0 | clean ✓ |
| `agent_contexts` | 7 | 7 | both untouched ✓ |

`cosmique-df4dd00d` (the mandate-protected duplicate) was not touched. cosmique-only test artifacts (`TEST_CC_PHASE10A_*`) leaked zero rows.

## Outstanding Phase 10B items

1. **Trigger Lovable Publish** to deploy commit `f7e3a35`, then run `npx playwright test --project=phase10a-e2e` to flip the 2 Add-dialog tests from DEPLOY_PENDING → REAL_PASS.
2. **Re-audit `/marketing/competitors`, `/marketing/blogs`, `/marketing/seo`** with longer `waitForSelector` budget — these timed out cold-cache in 10A.1.
3. **Add data-testid to `/clinic/health-reports` Upload Report button** — currently semantic-only.
4. **Full doctor avatar FULL_FLOW_PASS** — Phase 11 spec that uploads → switches to Review Queue → clicks Approve → polls `video_url` to non-null (MuseTalk render).
5. **Phase 10A.3 spec cleanup hardening pattern #12** — when a chain creates rows in 4 tables via a single webhook, `finally`-block cleanup must capture all 4 ids upfront and DELETE each by exact id, not by FK back-reference (the `report_id` filter pattern failed because `clinic_health_analyses` uses `report_ids` plural array column).
