# COORDINATION — Gold/Jewelry Vertical (Project JX)

> Cross-session coordination log for the Gold/Jewelry industry vertical build.
> Every Claude Code session working on JX must read this file first, then append a log line.
> If another session is mid-change in an area you intend to touch, note the collision and avoid it.

## Locks (claim before editing a shared file in a later phase)

> Phase 0 is read-only and claims NO locks. The table below is the registry future build phases must use.

| Shared resource | Held by | Since | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~TENANT-PROVISION~~ | ~~`jx-p1-provision`~~ | — | ✅ **RELEASED 2026-06-04T19:25Z**. Phase 1 done: `legacy-jewellers` (`f1abef0c-…`) + owner login provisioned & verified; zero cross-tenant impact (control byte-identical). |
| ~~DB-SCHEMA-JX~~ | ~~`jx-p3-schema`~~ | — | ✅ **RELEASED 2026-06-04T20:20Z**. Phase 3 done: 15 `jx_*` tables + canonical RLS + Legacy seed live; bidirectional RLS isolation proven (20/20); no existing table touched. Future `jx_*` DDL (ledger phase) should re-claim this lock. |
| ~~FE-SIDEBAR~~ | ~~`jx-p5-inventory`~~ | — | ✅ **RELEASED 2026-06-04T21:40Z**. Added "Inventory" to the Jewelry section on `feat/jx-p5`. Not deployed. |

## Collision notes

- 2026-06-04 — `repo/` clone is on `main` and clean. `frontend/` clone is on `fix/hr-recruitment-sourcing-chain` with ~63 untracked probe files (a different, unrelated session's working tree). JX docs live in the `repo/` clone on branch `feat/jx-p0` to avoid that dirty tree. No overlap.
